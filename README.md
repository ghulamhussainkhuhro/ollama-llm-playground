# Ollama LLM Playground 

This repo is my personal lab for learning and experimenting with **local LLMs using Ollama**.  
It includes:

- 🔹 **Custom Modelfiles** for different model personalities (concise, creative, etc.)
- 🔹 **Python scripts** for chatting, memory bots, and RAG
- 🔹 **Mini projects** like PDF QA and voice assistants
- 🔹 **Notes** to keep track of key learnings
